## Defining a function to solve for its zeros by subdividing the interval into 10 evenly spaced regions

import numpy as np
num = 10
xmin = -1
xmax = 1
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, num)
fx = np.sin(x)

## Multiplying the product of two consecutive points in order to see if it is positive, negative, or zero

for i in range(0,num-1):
    product = fx[i]*fx[i+1]
    if product < 0:
        print((x[i]+x[i+1])/2)
