## Define a function with a large subdivision of steps in order to find the absolute minimum of the function

import numpy as np
num = 100000
xmin = -10
xmax = 10
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, num)
fx = x**2

## After each step, we store the new lowest value
## If the new value is lower than the previous, then the new lowest is stored
## The absolute lowest value is returned once the boundary is reached

minimum = fx[0]
min_idx = 0
ctr = 0
for fxi in fx:
    if fxi < minimum:
        minimum = fxi
        min_idx = ctr
    ctr +=1
print(minimum)
