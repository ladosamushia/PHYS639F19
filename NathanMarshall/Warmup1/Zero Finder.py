This algorithm searches for the zeros of a discrete function f(x). First, the 
algorithm searches for places where the product of two adjacent points is
negative. This indicates a zero crossing, and then a simple interpolation is 
applied to more accurately approximate for what x f(x) is equal to zero. If no 
zero crossing is detected, the approximate derivative is calculated at each 
point in f(x). When a switch in the sign of the derivative is detected, this 
indicates an extrema of f(x). The extrema values of f(x) and their 
corresponding x values are printed out. This allows zeros of functions that 
just brush the x-axis to still be detected. Here it is shown finding the zeros
of sin(x) from -3*pi/2 to 3*pi/2.
